=Displaying Strings Using pyp =

There are three ways that you can bring in strings 


*Example 1 * - Using Echo
{{{
$ echo 'hello world' | pyp
   hello world
}}}

*Example 2 * - Using Files
{{{   
$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_1.txt | pyp
   hello world
   world hello
$ pyp --rerun "p"
   hello world
   world hello
}}}
*PYP NOTE:* "p" represents each line of the input as a python string.  Every time pyp runs, it buffers it's input to disk, so if you want to run it again with the same input, just use the *--rerun* flag. This is handy when the commands fed into pyp take a while to run, or if you are cutting and pasting input as shown below.

*Example 3 * - Using pyp manually by cutting/pasting text
{{{
$ pyp
   hello world #'hello world' was copied/pasted and executed by using CTRL-D
$ pyp --rerun 
   hello world
}}}
*NOTE: *  All three examples can accomplish the exact same thing.
