=Displaying Strings Using pyp =

There are three ways that you can bring in strings 


*Example 1 * - Using Echo
   *$ echo 'hello world' | pyp*
         hello world

*Example 2 * - Using Files
   *$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_1.txt | pyp*
         hello world
         world hello
   *$ pyp -r "p"*
         hello world
         world hello

*PYP NOTE:* In this example you don't have to use "p" but its important to show that "p" represents the line in which it is working on. So pyp is doing a recursive Read for p (or reading each line). This is extremely important when you need to specify the variable from other variables.

*Example 3 * - Using pyp manually by typing/pasting text
   *$ pyp*
         hello world
   *$ pyp -r *
         hello world

*NOTE: *  All three examples can accomplish the exact same thing. Most times its easier to do pyp manually so you don't have to create a text file.
