Below are some basic examples for using Pyed Piper (a.k.a. - pyp)

----
==Displaying Strings Using pyp==

There are three ways that you can bring in strings 

*Example 1 * - Using Echo
{{{
$ echo 'hello world' | pyp
   hello world
}}}

*Example 2 * - Using Files
{{{   
$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_1.txt | pyp #file can be found on downloads page
   hello world
   world hello
$ pyp --rerun "p"
   hello world
   world hello
}}}
*PYP NOTE:* "p" represents each line of the input as a python string.  Every time pyp runs, it buffers it's input to disk, so if we want to run it again with the same input, just use the *--rerun* flag. This is handy when the commands fed into pyp take a while to run, or if we are cutting and pasting input as shown below.

*Example 3 * - Using pyp manually by cutting/pasting text
{{{
$ pyp
   hello world #'hello world' was copied/pasted and executed by using CTRL-D
$ pyp --rerun 
   hello world
}}}
*NOTE: *  All three examples will accomplish the exact same thing.

----
==Splitting with pyp==
Pyed Piper has built-in functions that are designed to easily split on specific characters (ie - slashes, dashes, spaces) or can manually be given strings to split on.

*Example 1 * - Splitting on slashes

$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_2.txt | pyp   
   /MyDocuments/examples/movie_directory/movie/2011_05_20/mymovie_frames.180.mov
   /MyDocuments/examples/movie_directry/frames/swin_is_the_man/tiff/swin@work.tiff
   /MyDocuments/examples/movie_directory/movie/2011_05_20/Cool Movie:swin-flight.mov

# this cats a file and loads it into pyp.

$ pyp --rerun "s"
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]examples[2]movie_directory[3]movie[4]2011_05_20[5]mymovie_frames.180.mov]
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]examples[2]movie_directry[3]frames[4]swin_is_the_man[5]tiff[6]swin@work.tiff]
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]examples[2]movie_directory[3]movie[4]2011_05_20[5]Cool Movie:swin-flight.mov]

$ pyp --rerun "s[1]"
   examples
   examples
   examples

$ pyp --rerun "s[-1]"
   mymovie_frames.180.mov
   swin@work.tiff
   Cool Movie:swin-flight.mov

$ pyp --rerun "s[2:4]"
   [[0]movie_directory[1]movie]
   [[0]movie_directry[1]frames]
   [[0]movie_directory[1]movie]

$ pyp --rerun "s[2:4] | s"
   movie_directory/movie
   movie_directry/frames
   movie_directory/movie

}}}

*PYP NOTE:* With Pyed Piper we can split just like python's interpreter. For this example the "s" variable is splitting on all slashes and putting them into a python list. For more information feel free to go to python's documentation: [http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/string-methods.html python-docs_string-methods]

*Example 2 * - Splitting on white-spaces
{{{
<"tcsh shell" - text file can be found on downloads page >

$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_2.txt | pyp "w"   
   [[0]/MyDocuments/examples/movie_directory/movie/2011_05_20/mymovie_frames.1000_1180.mov]
   [[0]/MyDocuments/examples/movie_directry/frames/swin_is_the_man/tiff/swin@work.tiff]
   [[0]/MyDocuments/examples/movie_directory/movie/2011_05_20/Cool[1]Movie:swin-flight.mov]

$ pyp --rerun "w[1]"
   Movie:swin-flight.mov
}}}
*PYP NOTE:* Because only one path had a whitespace, when we specified `[1]`, the path that had the whitespace was the only one returned.

In Pyed Piper, there are several built-in functions that we can split with.  Here is the list of those other functions:

||`s`  OR `slash`||          p split/joined on "/" || 
|| `d`  OR `dot`  ||          p split/joined on "."    ||    
||`w`  OR `whitespace`  ||   p split/joined on whitespace (on spaces,tabs,etc)||
||`u`  OR `underscore` ||    p split/joined on '*_'   ||    
||`c`  OR `colon`     ||     p split/joined on ':'  ||
||`mm` OR `comma`    ||      p split/joined on ',' || 
||`m`  OR `minus`   ||       p split/joined on '-'   ||
||`a`  OR `all`       ||     p split on `[' '-_=$...]` (on "All" metacharacters)||

[http://code.google.com/p/pyp/wiki/pyp_manual#SPLIT_OR_JOIN_VARIABLES_BASED_ON_p_BEING_A_STRING_OR_LIST TableLink]

*Example 3 * - Splitting on EVERY meta-characters 
{{{
<"tcsh shell" - text file can be found on downloads page >

$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_2.txt | pyp --rerun "a" 
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]examples[2]movie[3]directory[4]movie[5]2011[6]05[7]20[8]mymovie[9]frames[10]180[11]mov]
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]examples[2]movie[3]directry[4]frames[5]swin[6]is[7]the[8]man[9]tiff[10]swin[11]work[12]tiff]
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]examples[2]movie[3]directory[4]movie[5]2011[6]05[7]20[8]Cool[9]Movie[10]swin[11]flight[12]mov]
}}}

*Example 4 * - Splitting manually 
{{{
<"tcsh shell" - text file can be found on downloads page >

$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_2.txt | pyp "p.split('examples')" 
   [[0]/MyDocuments/[1]/movie_directory/movie/2011_05_20/mymovie_frames.180.mov]
   [[0]/MyDocuments/[1]/movie_directry/frames/swin_is_the_man/tiff/swin@work.tiff]
   [[0]/MyDocuments/[1]/movie_directory/movie/2011_05_20/Cool Movie:swin-flight.mov]

$ pyp --rerun "p.split('/')" 
   [[0][1]MyDocuments[2]examples[3]movie_directory[4]movie[5]2011_05_20[6]mymovie_frames.180.mov]
   [[0][1]MyDocuments[2]examples[3]movie_directry[4]frames[5]swin_is_the_man[6]tiff[7]swin@work.tiff]
   [[0][1]MyDocuments[2]examples[3]movie_directory[4]movie[5]2011_05_20[6]Cool Movie:swin-flight.mov]

}}}
*PYP NOTE:* Splitting manually will only take a string; however, its important that we use single quotes *(double quotes will not work in this case)*. In the second demonstration, "p" represents each line of the input as a python string.  When we type p.split('$STRING') you are saying for that line split on this string. 

----
==Splitting and Joining with pyp==
With Pyed Piper you have the ability to split and join a number of ways. 
*Example 1 *- Splitting and Joining using variables 
{{{
<"tcsh shell" - text file can be found on downloads page >

$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_3.txt | pyp "s"
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]swin[2]pyp[3]examples[4]tutorial_for_pyp.jpg]
   [[0]MyDocuments[1]swin[2]pyp[3]examples[4]pyp_is_awesome.jpg]

$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_3.txt | pyp "s | u"
   MyDocuments_swin_pyp_examples_tutorial_for_pyp.jpg
   MyDocuments_swin_pyp_examples_pyp_is_awesome.jpg

}}}
*PYP NOTE:* In this example we used two variables (slashes and underscores) to signify what we want to split and join on.  By piping into a different variable, we are telling pyp that we want to split on slashes and pipe the list back in but add underscores for each list item.

It is also important to note that switching all slashes with underscores will not take the place of whats in the buffer.  If you were to type `pyp --rerun` the slashes would return.  If we wanted to put the put the new underscore string version in the buffer please check out *Pyed Piper and Pipes* 

*Example 2 *- Specific Splitting/Joining
{{{
<"tcsh shell" - text file can be found on downloads page >
$ cat /location/to/file/exercise_3.txt | pyp "'_'.join(p.split('/'))" #file can be found on downloads 
   _MyDocuments_swin_pyp_examples_tutorial_for_pyp.jpg
   _MyDocuments_swin_pyp_examples_pyp_is_awesome.jpg
$ pyp --rerun "'HELLO'.join(p.split('examples'))"
   /MyDocuments/swin/pyp/HELLO/tutorial_for_pyp.jpg
   /MyDocuments/swin/pyp/HELLO/pyp_is_awesome.jpg

}}}
*PYP NOTE:* In this example we specifically told pyp that we wanted to split/join together.  We are being very specific in what we want to split on and join in back.  The first part, we just split and joined like example 1; however, in second part, we specified that we wanted to split on the string `'examples'` and join the list with a string `'HELLO'`.
